However, on the Nickelodeon show, they do not, as seen in the picture below.\n\nEvidence Pro: My sisters are 9 and 6, and they even told me they don't look like chipmunks. Sometimes when I'm watching the show, I forget they're even chipmunks!\n\nEvidence Con: Alvin! And the Chimpmunks' characters look a lot like chipmunks and they even sound like them. If they aren't chipmunks then I don't know what else they could be.\n\nEvidence Con: Ok so maybe they don't look exactly like chipmunks with their hair and clothing, but the show is intended for younger audiences. Most kids can tell they are chipmunks and like the cartoony look of them.\n\nEvidence Con: Yeah so they aren't the most realistic representation of chipmunks, but most people are able to tell what they are. Overall, the chipmunks look realistic enough with their tails and fur.\n","DiscussionID":"00000116","Title":"The 'Alvinn! and the Chipmunks' characters don't even look like chipmunks","CrawlDate":"2016/09/29 03:23:19","URL":"http://www.debate.org/debates/The-Alvinn-and-the-Chipmunks-characters-dont-even-look-like-chipmunks/1/"},"ArgumentList":[{"Argument":{"ConclusionStartPos":154,"ConclusionEndPos":227,"nextID":"00000002","PremiseStartPos":[279],"prevID":"00000000","Premise":["If you watch the Alvinn! and the Chipmunks show on Nickelodeon, you;ll see that they do not look like chipmunks."],"PremiseEndPos":[392],"ArgumentID":"00000001","Conclusion":"The 'Alvinn! and the Chipmunks' characters don't even look like chipmunks","PremiseStance":["Pro"]}},{"Argument":{"ConclusionStartPos":154,"ConclusionEndPos":227,"nextID":"00000003","PremiseStartPos":[407],"prevID":"00000001","Premise":["On the movies, like, The Road Chip, they do look and sound like chipmunks.
