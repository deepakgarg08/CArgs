It's sad but true. Having been banned from driving for five years, a very good friend of mine celebrated the recent return of his licence by purchasing a 1963 Series III Bentley Continental Drophead Coupe finished in midnight blue with coachwork by Mulliner Park Ward, fitted out with magnolia Connolly hide and inlaid walnut appliquï¿½s. On the day it was delivered, he proudly drove off in the direction of the pub intending to show the car off to his mates but he had only gone a couple of blocks when disaster struck. Suddenly, and completely without warning, a middle-aged woman decided to cross the road right in front of him. She came out between two parked cars so there was absolutely no way he could avoid her and she subsequently hit the car square on. As a result of this collision, the woman went over the top of the car, causing a large rip in the colour-coded mohair soft-top roof in the process. Worse still, her wheelchair seriously damaged the Bentley's lovingly-polished, hand-crafted, chromium-plated radiator grill. Since the police agreed that my friend was totally blameless he sensibly employed a decent firm of lawyers to take legal action against the woman in order to recover the costs he had incurred as a result of the incident and the court duly found in his favour. However, before the woman had discharged her substantial financial liability to my friend she died from the injuries she sustained in the accident, tragically leaving my friend to pay the repair bills and legal costs. Now, this woman wasn't without means and she left her son, the sole beneficiary of her will, her entire estate which included both cash and property. Naturally, my friend approached her son in order to remind him of his mother's debt to him but, regretfully, he was unable to appeal to the man's sense of propriety and no payment was forthcoming. On taking further legal advice it transpired that the woman's son was under no obligation to settle my friend's claim and, indeed, no firm of lawyers or even a debt collection agency agreed to pursue his case. As a result, my friend is now left contemplating sending some hired muscle round to visit the woman's son in order to emphasise his moral duties with regard to the matter, but surely it shouldn't be the case that he has to go to yet further expense in order to recover the money he is owed? Surely he should be afforded the protection of the law? After all, he has suffered a considerable financial loss through no fault of his own. You see, I told you it was a sad story. Unfortunately, though, this type of tale it is far from unique and, as the law stands, many people have to write off debts when their creditors die, even though the beneficiaries of their estates inherit the financial resources to pay the deceased parties' dues. Therefore, I hereby affirm that if a deceased person's wealth can be inherited, then so should their debts. Thank you.\n\nEvidence Pro: Hello again theLwerd and thanks for taking this debate. In reply to my opponent's contribution, I wouldn't say my friend's solicitor is a lousy lawyer, rather that my friend is very unlucky, as she rightly observed. Indeed, he's always been unlucky - I reckon if he fell into a bag of t!ts he'd come out sucking his thumb! In his case, had the woman that caused the damage to his car up refused to pay, he could have taken a charge on her house and forced her to sell it to get his money but she didn't refuse to pay, she just died before she had a chance to write him a cheque. No, it is her grasping, insensitive son who my friend has got an issue with, although, in fairness, there wouldn't be a problem in the first place if his late mother had been more careful when crossing the road, although in fairness to her, she had just been to the rotisserie to pick up a freshly cooked chicken and was being chased down the street by a pack of stray dogs immediately prior to the accident, which might have distracted her a bit. So, my opponent is right in saying that if debts are secured against the property, the beneficiary would be liable to pay, but is wrong to say that all debts must be paid from the deceased's estate - the executor of the will need not settle unsecured any loans or debts. For example, say this woman had bought on credit a stair-lift so she could get upstairs to the bathroom; the retailer couldn't demand that the outstanding payments be made from her estate when she died. They could go round to her house and take it back, but they probably wouldn't bother because each unit is made bespoke and the chair itself wouldn't be worth much, especially if she was incontinent. Or say the woman had outstanding fines that the courts had imposed upon her for thieving roasted chickens or for driving her wheelchair recklessly, her son wouldn't have to pay them off when she snuffed it. At the end of the day, we all suffer when the beneficiaries of a will don't cough up. The parties who have to write off their debts are often companies that provide unsecured credit on their goods and services. This means they have to increase their prices to cover bad debts. In other words, ordinary, hard-working consumers have to pay more for goods and services just so people who inherit unearned property and cash can dodge their financial liabilities. In effect, decent honest people are paying for the posh to quaff champagne and gorge themselves on fois gras, white truffles and caviar. No, that's not fair and I, therefore, reaffirm that if someone can inherit a deceased persons' wealth, they should also be liable for their debts. Thank you.\n\nEvidence Con: It seems as if Brian's friend had a terrible attorney. When someone dies, their estate is left for someone to handle (typically a spouse, child or lawyer). That individual -- in this case, it would be the woman's son -- is responsible for making sure that all final bills are paid on behalf of the deceased. The first thing to pay off are secured debts, i.e. mortgages, car payments, or any debts that were expected to be paid off over a certain amount of time. Next, any medical bills or other debts are required to be paid off; it seems as if Brian's friend had the court on his side in this one in determining that the woman did indeed have a debt to him. As such, Brian's friend should have had no trouble in legally collecting all money presumed owed to him. Now, because this resolution encompasses more than just Brian's friend, I'll continue. You cannot inherit a debt unless (a) you were a party to it prior to the debtor's death, or (b) you have a joint credit card or bank account with the indebted deceased. This is for obvious reasons. If it's not clear to you, I'll explain: Why should someone be responsible for another's debt when they had absolutely nothing to do with it or no say/decision in the matter? More importantly, who gets to decide who that responsible someone is? Surely one would say, \"Well the person benefiting from the deceased's assets, of course!\" Well, yes and no. The beneficiary is responsible by law to use those assets, i.e. sell them for money, to pay off ANY debt on behalf of the dead. In that case, the debt wouldn't be inherited - it would be paid off using whatever the dead left behind first and foremost before any type of inheritance could take place. Now, in a situation where there were no assets, the answer is \"Tough luck\" to any creditors who don't get paid (that's why credit is bad in the first place -- it's an assumed and accepted risk). Similarly, if there were no assets in this case, then Brian's friend would simply unfortunately have to accept the loss. It would be a tragic accident, the same way a tree falling on Brian's friend's car would be a tragic accident, but he would not be entitled to anything further than what his insurance company was willing or required to pay. Indeed there's a lot of bad ck out there and sometimes we're the recipients of it. It happens. In this case, I'm very surprised that the debt is even an issue. Nevertheless, this bad luck is not enough to take legal action to punish an innocent party monetarily. I'll stand by that statement until my opponent responds. Good luck!\n\nEvidence Con: A few things: First, Brian says that the woman who died simply did so before ever being able to write his friend a check. That seems unlikely since she apparently got beat up so badly to the point where she died, but more importantly, you'll notice that back in R1 Pro wrote, \"Since the police agreed that my friend was totally blameless... the court duly found in his favour.\" Since the court ruled in the plaintiff's favor, it implies that at least some type of official legal action was taken, and as such my point about the woman's son being responsible for the debt stands (especially if there were any types of records or documents, which there is for every legal endeavor). Second, Brian provides an example of a purchase (debt) which would not have to be paid off upon the person dying. He is completely right; I thought I already addressed that in R1 when mentioning the \"tough luck\" kinds of debts, but it seems I forgot to include that specifically when talking about how any credit purchase is bad for the creditor. Regardless, the same argument still applies; I'm not offering a new one. As I said, there is some assumed and accepted risk when giving credit to someone. As such, the creditor makes a decision to accept that risk in the hope that they'll profit from the interest of the credit. Because they do that willingly, then the risk is part of the deal and I don't think that's a decent enough argument to burden someone else with the debt when they had nothing to do with it in the first place. Meanwhile, the creditor did and is in fact responsible for that existing debt. Regarding the example with the outstanding fines for stealing chickens, I stand by my statement that all debts in the form of fines must first be paid [1], as that isn't so much a debt that a creditor chose to take a risk on, but rather something on the record for which the deceased was responsible (similar to her responsibility to Brian's friend). Additionally, if we have a problem with credit rate being increased because of debts that aren't paid, we can simply choose not to buy anything on credit or choose a provider with a lower rate. Additionally, Brian never proved why someone should be responsible for a debt that they had nothing to do with. Suppose the deceased's assets and estate did not cover the total amount of the debt owed. The living would then be burdened; and further, I've already asked (and didn't receive an answer) as to whom that living should be, especially in the case where there was no estate/assets to be inherited. For instance, if I were estranged from my father for 20 years, but then he died and I inherited his debt, that would not only be incredibly cruel but also undoubtedly an infringement of rights -- you simply cannot impose another's debt onto someone outside of legal parameters.
