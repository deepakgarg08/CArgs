Tupac did not own Biggie, since ownership involves possession. Since slavery in America no longer exists, it is not possible for Biggie to be a slave. Although human trafficking does occur, I do not believe that Biggie was a slave for the following reasons: 1) Biggie was born in the United States. Human trafficking occurs from smuggling people from one country to another. 2) Biggie spent his money. If Tupac owned Biggie, then Tupac would have taken all of Biggies money. 3) Biggie was too popular for his life as a slave by Tupac to be unnoticed. Somebody would speculate and the media would have discovered this incident. 4) Biggie and Tupac lived too far away for Biggie to be Tupac's slave. If Tupac were to own Biggie, then he would have to live closer, to better control him.\n\nEvidence Con: Since Pro did not provide a definition of \"own\" in the first round and left the meaning of \"own\" very ambiguous, I was right to assume the definition of own to be \"involving possession\", especially since Pros definition of \"own\" is not defined in the dictionary but rather in the urbandictionary. However, I will make an argument using Pro's definition, even though this is the last round, due to the misunderstanding. However looking at the definition of \"own\": 1.To win a round in a game. (usually a video/pc game) 2.To beat someone at a game.(usually a video/pc game) 3. To be better at someone. (usually a video/pc game) Where does tupac own biggie? What game is tupac winning? If we're referring to in the context of rap, I'd like to note that one cannot 'beat' someone in rap (no pun intended) since the music industry is not a contest, it is about creating a music that others enjoy and that you enjoy. There are no winners or losers, since some artist prefer to reach different audiences, while others wish to reach a broad audience. However, biggie is a distinguished rapper, with MTV ranking him the third greatest rapper of all time and obtained a four time Platinum album for \"Ready to Die\" While based on what I stated about the music industry earlier, while I really can't prove that biggie is a better rapper than tupac, since it is subjective, you can't prove that tupac is a better rapper than biggie so the resolution is negated.\n","DiscussionID":"00000109","Title":"tupac owns bigggie","CrawlDate":"2016/09/29 07:37:54","URL":"http://www.debate.org/debates/tupac-owns-bigggie/1/"},"ArgumentList":[{"Argument":{"ConclusionStartPos":106,"ConclusionEndPos":124,"nextID":"00000002","PremiseStartPos":[176],"prevID":"00000000","Premise":["tupac owns bigge smalls specially with hit em up do you gotta betta song den that?"],"PremiseEndPos":[259],"ArgumentID":"00000001","Conclusion":"tupac owns bigggie","PremiseStance":["Pro"]}},{"Argument":{"ConclusionStartPos":106,"ConclusionEndPos":124,"nextID":"00000003","PremiseStartPos":[274],"prevID":"00000001","Premise":["wtf u on about im talkin about OWNING. not self whatever. check it : OWN to be bet."],"PremiseEndPos":[358],"ArgumentID":"00000002","Conclusion":"tupac owns bigggie","PremiseStance":["Pro"]}},{"Argument":{"ConclusionStartPos":106,"ConclusionEndPos":124,"nextID":"00000004","PremiseStartPos":[373],"prevID":"00000002","Premise":["I'd like to thank my opponent for starting this debate.
