One thing to clarify first is that the criteria are to confirm your identity and COMPLETE three debates, not start three.\n\nEvidence Pro: CTQ forfeited this round. Con What a waste of a round!\n\nEvidence Con: 1st Round will only be acceptance. I am going to say that \"Why these criteria should not exist in order to vote\" in debates.org and that they should remove these criteria Their criterias in order to votes are: CONFIRM YOUR IDENTITY START 3 DEBATES\n\nEvidence Con: First of all. Thank you Pro for accepting my debate. My reason for this debate is to understand why is it necessary to keep conditions for voting. This is not actually a debate. However, My understanding is as follow: 1) They should remove these conditions because it may affect the privacy right of ever DDO member by asking about their identity. You know not everyone would be comfortable in giving their mobile number to a site. Which makes it very very hard to 1) trust that site and easy to 2) give up the idea of voting and inorder to win a debate we need people who can vote because when you debate we need GENERALIZED opinions and voting, not just who are allowed to. This is kind of making newbies seem backward as well. 2) The need for completing 3 debates does not make sense if you want to vote on any other debate. It's just like saying that! \"Hey I know you want ice-cream, but I will feed you pasta instead!\". Makes no sense. This is why either they have to impose other REASONABLE criteria or have no criteria at all. THATS ALL FOLKS!\n\nEvidence Con: What a waste of a round!\n","DiscussionID":"00000004","Title":"Criteria to vote should not exist in debates.org","CrawlDate":"2016/09/29 03:00:34","URL":"http://www.debate.org/debates/Criteria-to-vote-should-not-exist-in-debates.org/1/"},"ArgumentList":[{"Argument":{"ConclusionStartPos":134,"ConclusionEndPos":182,"nextID":"00000002","PremiseStartPos":[234],"prevID":"00000000","Premise":["I accept.
