Round 3: Rebuttals Round 4: Rebuttals Round 5: Closing arguments and final rebuttals. Thank you to whoever accepts this debate. I hope the person I am debating is a capitalist or a supporter of capitalism.\n\nEvidence Pro: Sadly, my opponent has closed his account. Therefore, he cannot respond to my arguments. I hope my opponent returns. It is only fair for the voters that I make at least one argument. What socialism would be like? Uprooting of racial discrimination There will be no more of racial discrimination. Employers will have no choice but to pay people equally for equal labour. Therefore, any types of discrimination will be abolished. Free access to birth control Anyone in puberty or above can have birth control for free. There will be very little STDs because some people today cannot afford birth control. Free health care Everyone can have free health care that needs it. Furthermore, it will also be allowed to have private/paid health care if you want that. So you will have a choice. Police and Prisons Capitalist police, along with the whole capitalist state apparatus, will be smashed by the revolution. Workers\u2019 councils will exercise police power through a workers\u2019 militia so long as the exercise of police power remains necessary. Once the counterrevolution has been solidly defeated, capital punishment will be abolished forever. The horrible prisons existing under capitalism, while they may be used temporarily for those who oppose the revolution by force, will begin to be replaced immediately with rehabilitation programs that allow most law violators to remain at home during their sentence or at pleasant reform camps staffed by skilled psychologists and social workers. At these camps or resorts, prisoners will have privacy in their quarters and be allowed regular visits by their wives and husbands. They will have opportunity for education, recreation and productive work at the going wage. All those serving time when the revolution comes to power will have their cases reviewed and be released or reassigned to a resort (The wardens and guards of capitalist prisons may be among the first assigned to these reform resorts.) The capitalist courts will be junked in favor of workers\u2019 tribunals which will act according to a new and simplified code of social justice. Bourgeois law books will be sent to the museum. Eventually, even this softened coercive apparatus will be allowed to wither away, as the concept of crime recedes into the past. Education Socialist schools will be radically different from the regimented, authoritarian schools we see in capitalist society today. Students and faculty will jointly administer the schools, just as they will participate in the government of society as a whole through their elected deputies to the soviets or councils that will administer the state and economy. Along with an immediate and continuing upgrading in the range and quality of course material, we can project more free time for students all the way down to elementary level for self-study of topics they wish to pursue, more boarding schools, more freedom for students to travel from one geographic area to another. Of course, there will be free access to education all the way to the postgraduate level. In addition, there will very likely be special programs conducted for everyone \u2013 to teach languages for example, an area of backwardness in this country that will need to be remedied in an internationalist society. Production and Distribution The revolution, in coming to power, will nationalize the major means of production and exchange, bringing into existence a new mode of production, based on social ownership of the means of production and collective appropriation of the social surplus product. While workers will continue to be paid wages in money to exchange for commodities during a long initial period, a socialist mode of distribution will eventually replace the old method as abundance overtakes scarcity and automation and cybernation eliminate human labor from the sphere of production. It is entirely realistic to speculate that, within a century after the insurrection, money and commodity production will have withered away as absurdities in an economy requiring no human labor and producing more than enough to satisfy the needs of everyone. Long before this happens, workers will have ceased to have to pay individually for rent, food, medical care or transportation. The length of the work week will be sharply reduced immediately and very soon after that cut in half. The management of shops and factories will be in the hands of those who work there. Again, more than administering their own workplace, these workers will also participate in the administration of the whole economy and society through their elected delegates. Other things The motto of the Socialist group is \"People and Nature BEFORE profits.\" Therefore, the people and workers have control in their company. In addition, there is equal pay for equal labour.
