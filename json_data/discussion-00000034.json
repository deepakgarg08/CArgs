They are also softer and quieter.\n\nEvidence Pro: Adri_Angel forfeited this round. Con In certain scenarios, a dog would be more reliable than most cats. Take a robbery as one, if you were getting robbed and you were at home, I doubt a cat would help you. Most likely run off unlike a dog. In that scenario, the dog would most likely attack the robber or warn you.

On a reliability level, and caring level.\n\nEvidence Pro: Adri_Angel forfeited this round. Con Well since my contender has failed to back her opinion up, twice and forfeited, I believe I do win. Dogs are better than cats because they are more loyal and loving. Cats fail to offer any sort of love and care and are more agressive.
