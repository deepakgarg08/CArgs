First round for acceptance.\n\nEvidence Pro: Chapter 1: You have a question mark on your back because you don't know who is feeding to you in the rear. Also, I heard your mother sucks penis behind the Pita Pit for spare change and food stamps, as your fat slob of a dad is too busy scarfing down Cheetos to even care about that endangered whale you call a mom. They went to counselling, but even the best therapist in New York couldn't heal those salty wounds. They always discussed how you were better off as a cum stain on your whore of a mother's bed sheets that she stole from the lost and found bin. They also always wished to have a boy, as they didn't want to deal with your dripping blood stains that would be sure to come. You also never had a prom date, as you were only good for being a cum dumpster for some scruffy looking dude in a Metallica shirt. Your face looked like chewed up meat in high school, now you look like Shrek fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. You are so desperate for penis, and you would take it raw on your period to get off because of your filthy ways. PS. The last time you tried to use a douche, it pointed and said \"what's that?!\" and ran away it was so scared of that Dungeons and Dragons death trap you call a vagina. The Poem My opponent decided to call herself anomalous To hide the fact she's wide and fat just like a rhinoceros Her face is so awful that she has to remain anonymous And prays every day to look less like a hippopotamus It's sad, she's fat but she can't even fight Plus her tits remind you of misquito bites She looks good....to those with eyes closed really tight After this she will cry and want to leave the site Turn a frog into a prince? You would be lucky to kiss a toad I home a semi smashes into you the next time you cross the road It must feel like crap having noone to hold But what do you expect? Your breath that smells like onions and mold You probably salivate at the thought of getting cream pied But every time you queef the people across the street die\n\nEvidence Pro: She gave up :( ....I'll still give Rossane Barr a chance in her next round. Hopefully, she doesn't get too many Ruffles stains on her keyboard.\n\nEvidence Pro: If I really wasn't worthy of \"a single character\" like you say, then you wouldn't have just responded in your last round. Nice way to contradict yourself. I guesse my \"school-yard\" insults really got you afterall....Epic fail.\n\nEvidence Con: I accept.\n\nEvidence Con: anomalous forfeited this round. Pro She gave up :( ....I'll still give Rossane Barr a chance in her next round. Hopefully, she doesn't get too many Ruffles stains on her keyboard.\n\nEvidence Con: Forfeiting that round against you was the most insulting thing I could think of, as it indicates you're not even worthy of a single character, while you have shown that I am worthy of copious amounts of mildly amusing school-yard level insults.\n","DiscussionID":"00000022","Title":"I am more insulting than you","CrawlDate":"2016/09/29 05:42:18","URL":"http://www.debate.org/debates/I-am-more-insulting-than-you/1/"},"ArgumentList":[{"Argument":{"ConclusionStartPos":116,"ConclusionEndPos":144,"nextID":"00000002","PremiseStartPos":[196],"prevID":"00000000","Premise":["We shall just write insulting things back and forth; whoever is more insulting and entertaining/ clever with their insults wins.
