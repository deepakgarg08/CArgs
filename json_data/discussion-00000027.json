In one battle on Pok\"mon showdown, I used my blissey, my last pokemon, starting from turn 30 and lasted 70 turns and won against 5 legendaries. Don`t have the link, but just look for replays of Honestly Bossome vs. MyRecknTeam. Blissey is good because it has the absolute maximum base HP allowed by the game`s code: 255. (max base HP is calculated as a single byte, or 8 bits. Binary for 255 is 11111111, making it the absolute highest possible.) This mountain of health, capable of reaching the jaw-dropping amount of 714, is amazing when paired with it`s base 135 special defense. This makes Blissey next to IMPOSSIBLE to kill with special attacks. While it`s physical defense may be poor, if it can survive the attack, soft-boiled will heal that crap right up after they`ve used substitute to avoid the next incoming attack. Also, your physical attack does not matter if you have no moves that use it. (Substitute, Aromatherapy, Soft-Boiled, Seismic Toss being an example) You can`t even toxic stall blissey, as it`s ability Natural Cure instantly cures status effects upon switch. (That, or it just uses aromatherapy.)\n\nEvidence Pro: If both are same level, has 30% accuracy. If blissey`s level is higher, it is guaranteed not to hit.\n\nEvidence Pro: check mate.\n\nEvidence Con: Hello, Fissure, Blissey is KO'd. Just like the blacks Arnold Benjaman\n\nEvidence Con: Arnold_Benjaman forfeited this round. Pro check mate.\n\nEvidence Con: FUUuUUUUK YOU GO SUCK A TINY CHODE YOU WORTHLESS PEACE OF NIGGGER SCUM\n","DiscussionID":"00000027","Title":"Blissey is one of the best pokemon","CrawlDate":"2016/09/29 03:00:39","URL":"http://www.debate.org/debates/Blissey-is-one-of-the-best-pokemon/1/"},"ArgumentList":[{"Argument":{"ConclusionStartPos":113,"ConclusionEndPos":147,"nextID":"00000002","PremiseStartPos":[199],"prevID":"00000000","Premise":["Blissey is a very good pokemon.
