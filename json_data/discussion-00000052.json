Round 1: Acceptance Only Round 2: Arguments Round 3: Rebuttals and Closing\n\nEvidence Pro: My resolution is that I might be God. Might: Used to indicate a possibility or probability that is weaker than \"may\" [1] May: Used to indicate a certain measure of likelihood or possibility [2] Possibility: The fact or state of being possible [3] Possible: Capable of happening, existing, or being true without contradicting proven facts, laws, or circumstances. [4] So we see that in order for my resolution to be true, there has to be a possibility, even a weak one, that I am God. Looking at the definition of \"possible\", unless my opponent can present proven facts, laws, or circumstances showing that there is no possibility of me being God, my resolution stands. Good luck, Con. ---- [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nEvidence Pro: Extend all arguments. It is possible that God exists, and it is possible that I am God, unless there are proven facts, laws, or circumstances to the contrary. In his final round, my opponent must be able to present and properly source such proven evidence, or else I win by default. Thank you, voters, for your time.\n\nEvidence Con: You might NOT be God.\n\nEvidence Con: yomama12 forfeited this round. Pro Extend all arguments. It is possible that God exists, and it is possible that I am God, unless there are proven facts, laws, or circumstances to the contrary. In his final round, my opponent must be able to present and properly source such proven evidence, or else I win by default.
